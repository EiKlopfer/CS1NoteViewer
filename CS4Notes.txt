TODO:
Rufus fight - don't care about dupe, can kill faster?

3 Rider jackets? Putting extra speed on Fie now so maybe fine to leave on Rean? Help with shadow fight maybe?

Still pretty high on Brave Soul and Capsule count, can cut out any long walks? Or later Spirits as mira is fine then
  Zeram in Ordis sewers
  Spirit in Keep X
  

Sepith chest can drop?
  Probably all after Crossbell right? Is next big sepith use the sell in A3?
  
Clean up final dungeons notes
