You did it!

Things to look into:
  
Swap Alisa to Thor in Ignis Shrine
  Faster to select Chrono Burst this way
  Duvalie fight is a little scary still, Angel can help w/ bad turn order
  
Get Roar quartz later:
  Could do it after first Shrine so Fie already has upgraded SBreak
  Probably still do it in A2P4 though, avoids having to see map updates in Finale
  
Scarlet mech fight:
  Way to make the Sara strat consistent? Gaius strat is safe but slow
  Can we swap in Laura at some point to speed Gaius strat up? 
  Maybe get to 5BP and 200CP then bring in Laura for StrUp 50% into 5BP finish?
