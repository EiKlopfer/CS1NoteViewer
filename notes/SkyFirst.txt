TODO: Not Agate for final fight?
Tita gives group CP restore, so Joshua and Estelle do most of the damage instead. Better? Also less pressure on Schera's CP which is good if not enough Zeram
  If Tita is close to Agate in speed and really saves Zerams then might be worth to allow Zeram spam in Chap3/4 (Aero storm dropping off)
  Could potentially get ultimate weapons for Estelle/Joshua too since they are now DPS, again helps with Chap3/4 spam
  Need 2 Cut3s for this but easy enough to get that
  Every few rounds need to Mixed Cocktail Estelle/Joshua for EP but that also gives CP so not too painful
Olivier can use Fury to deal lots of damage if we can keep at low HP, probably doable with drinking Cocktails
  Dreamy Shell is good revive item for low HP, bad one gives 10HP
  Olivier also Craft boosts as support, free (random) damage
  
Ultimate Weapons?
Can buy Carn 8-11 after tournament. 8k,9k,10k,15k
Carn 6-7 before leaving Zeiss, 6k, 7k
Carn 5 in Ruan, 5k
Carn 1-4 in Bose Market, 1-4k


Rough timings on Richard
