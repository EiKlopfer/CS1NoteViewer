Most likely thing to cut from this route is the cooking
It isn't needed but the extra stats can help and we are in a lot of fights for a long time
My opinion is don't cut the evade cooking, they are pretty easy to get and 4 extra evade% when you have 80% is a lot
  You go from getting hit in 1/5 attacks to 1/6 attacks, 20% better. Something something non linear returns.
The speed recipes are more questionable (drill meatball and fish one), especially because they take extra fights to get ingredients
But reasons to still get:
  The extra speed does matter, just 2 speed saves a bit of delay on everything we do. Adds up over a long fight to maybe an extra turn
  We sometimes eat all of our drill meatballs, cooking an extra can matter
  The food item from the fish recipe gives HP regen, that is very helpful for the Crimson Tower fight vs Special Ops
    Agate can eat the HP Regen food to offset some of the Wild Rage damage and counter damage
