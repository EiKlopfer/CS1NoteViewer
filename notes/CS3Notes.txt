Open questions/things I still want to look into

Item routing:
PB ends with 2 Zeram Powders and a Brave Soul
Can we skip picking these up or use them to end some other fights sooner?
Some Chapter2 fights are iffy, think we have at least one of those Zeram Powders by then (reward from Shining Pom fights)
Brave Seeds are sold until mid Chap3, so can't use extras until after that point without risk to money route

Money routing:
We have a lot of CP food left over by end of game. Though by the time we buy the 45+ Passion Hotpots we aren't really under money constraints anymore anyway
Maybe we could spend that money that is going to food somewhere else but nothing really coming to mind. More Blitz Coats for speed?
More money early would help to pick up more CP food in Chap1/2 or more Silky Stews for str up without cast time but buying fewer Passion Hotpots doesn't help with that


Master Quartz setup:
Chapter 3 Field Study - we are a bit weak for the Trio fight (Duvalie, Ines, Ennea) on the island
  Could get Tatinia onto Musse main slot for this for more ATS, it should much more likely be level 5 too
  Can look to even try and equip this to Musse earlier, probably during major setup before Isopod
  Likely still need it to start on Altina for Keep fight though, that one is also a bit tight
Chapter 4 setup - We're putting Sirius on Juna in the keep but we probably shouldn't. We don't want her to have it on for the first Dark Dragon fight since then she would have insight which might make her get counter instead of Fie
  Probably swapping Juna and Altina's setup in the keep would just work and be better anyway. Juna will do more break damage to Keep boss and Altina will have Sirius in main slot which is fine.
  Later in Towa shop only need to put Pandora into sub slot for Altina, less changes
  Although is the Pandora sub even needed? I don't think current route even gets close to 7. Anything we could do to make it hit 7? Or skip doing any Altina setup in Towa shop?
Minotauros isn't always 7 for Azure Siegfried fight and sure would be nice if it was
  Anything easy we can do to get a little more XP on it? Probably not, we pretty much always have it on after we pick it up cause it is so good
  Maybe some high XP fight we can pick up some extra XP multiplier by spamming some extra orders for triple order? Final fight in Juno (Arianrhod and friends) is probably good option for this
