Things to think about:

--TODO: Left over quarts? Can sell more in Chap4? Open fewer chests?
--TODO: Force is often super close to level before Flower fight in Chap2, that level up makes the fight much easier and faster. Way to get it consistently to level up?
--TODO: Klaus fight still seems a bit iffy sometimes. Maybe have Rean run back w/ another Burst turn?
--TODO: Too much Zerum, can skip cat somewhere? Can make a fight faster by using?
---- Likely could skip Cat in chap5, that is the one with Emma event so extra slow. If fights are good then have 2 extra by end of Chap5. Could use one in Robot fight and skip cat to not have extras.
--TODO: Chapter 7 party? Using Laura for fast SCraft that can Overkill during grind. Leave Fie in cause she is setup from Chap6. Mil is stronger but don't think setup is worth it.
