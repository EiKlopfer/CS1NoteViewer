Things to think about:

--TODO: Left over quarts? Can sell more in Chap4? Open fewer chests?
--TODO: Too much Zerum, can skip cat somewhere? Can make a fight faster by using?
--TODO: Laura and Fie for Chapter 7? Need to do a little bit of extra targeting work but Fie is already setup from Chapter 6
---- Won't be able to clear all adds in Loa fight with single opening SBreak, that might add some risk
---- Laura w/ Brave could clear at least 2 at fight start without any downside, might be enough even if some are fast? Fie can kill the other adds without any Str boost, just lose damage on Loa
